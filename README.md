## Bamazon_NOT_Amazon is a mock amazon store interfance
### Link found here: ""
## Bamazon offers three different program files based on roles like:
* Customer
* Manager
* Supervisor
## When running each program, the user is prompted with approprite functionality which manipulates data on the MySQL server database that corresponds with the project.
### Careful when using the employee based programs, as Bamazon can be a bit moody... and NEVER call it "Amazon".
